# CHEAT ALERT
1. This repo is just for my self. I made it public so I could access it anywhere.

2. I passed the pool with no cheat at all, and it was an amazing experience.

3. always ask your mates

4. THOSE SOLUTIONS MIGHT NOT BE VALID SOLUTIONS.

# STRATEGY
Just wait until "abellaismail7" make an attempt and then get traces from him. HAHA HAHA
